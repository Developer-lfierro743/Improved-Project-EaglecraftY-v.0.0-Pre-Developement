### Improved Project-EaglecraftY Beta (v0.1)

(*Please refrain from any legal action, Mojang/MICROSOFT!)

## What is EaglecraftY?
**EaglecraftY** marks the Next Generation of EaglercraftX (based on Minecraft 1.8.8) and Eaglercraft (based on Minecraft 1.5.2), innovated by **lax1dude**. This rendition converts Java bytecode into JavaScript using **TeaVM**, enabling Minecraft to seamlessly run in web browsers. Diverging from its predecessors, EaglecraftY boasts entirely original assets, steering clear of DMCA and copyright concerns.
